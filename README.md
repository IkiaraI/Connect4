# Connect4

I have developed a Connect 4 game on python that implements; if/elif/else statements, functions, 
multiple variable types, operations, for and while loops, print and return statements, and file I/O. 
Connect 4 is a two player game so the program uses odd and even numbers to allow the users to take 
turns placing their chips on the game board. To personalize the game more, the program allows both 
users to enter a name along with the option to select different coloured chips. Using variable 
declaration for each column allows the program to keep track of the number of chips  on the 
board and whether the column or the entire board is full. After the game is over, the winner, 
loser and the duration of the game is written into the cps109_a1_output.txt file. However, 
the most challenging part is determining the winner since it is found by running through all 
possible ways, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally through the 7x6 board using for loops 
and list indexes to identify a sequence of four in a row.
